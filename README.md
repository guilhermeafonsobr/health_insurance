# Insurance All Company
Disclaimer: Proper explanations of the business context were not given. So I made some inferences to better describe the problem and the solution.

Insurance All is a company that provides health insurance to its customers and the product team is analyzing the possibility of offering policyholders a new product: auto insurance.

As with health insurance, customers of this new auto insurance plan need to pay an amount annually to Insurance All to obtain an amount insured by the company, aimed at the costs of an eventual accident or damage to the vehicle.

Insurance All conducted a survey of about 380,000 customers about their interest in joining a new auto insurance product last year. All customers expressed interest or not in purchasing auto insurance and these responses were saved in a database along with other customer attributes.

The product team selected 127 thousand new customers who did not respond to the survey to participate in a campaign, in which they will receive the offer of the new auto insurance product. The offer will be made by the sales team through telephone calls.

However, the sales team has the capacity to make 20 thousand calls within the campaign period.

# The challenge
In that context, you were hired as a Data Science consultant to build a model that predicts whether or not the customer would be interested in auto insurance.

With its solution, the sales team hopes to be able to prioritize the people with the greatest interest in the new product and, thus, optimize the campaign by making only contacts with customers most likely to make the purchase.

As a result of your consultancy, you will need to deliver a report containing some analysis and answers to the following questions:

Main insights on the most relevant attributes of customers interested in purchasing auto insurance.

1. What percentage of customers interested in purchasing auto insurance will the sales team be able to reach by making 20,000 calls?
2. And if the sales team's capacity increases to 40,000 calls, what percentage of customers interested in purchasing auto insurance will the sales team be able to contact?
3. How many calls does the sales team need to make to contact 80% of customers interested in purchasing auto insurance?

The Data The data set is available on the AWS platform and each row represents a customer and each column contains some attributes that describe that customer, in addition to her response to the survey, in which she mentioned interest or not in the new insurance product.
